### Annotating a site

First enter initials in the `annotations` column of `geojson_check.csv` at the given site you are annotating as a placeholder and indicator to other annotators to reduce overlap of efforts. 
1. Open the corresponding Geojson file for the site in [Geojson.io](http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0). Only the areas subsumed by polygons or rectangles need annotations. 
2. Open Sloth using the custom configuration file using the same command in the set-up above. 
3. Open all of the images for a single site (this creates one annotation file per site).
4. Annotate all vessels within AOIs to best of ability. Does not have to be perfect. 
5. Save the file periodically. When finished, upload to the annotations sub-directory in the shared folder using a file name that clearly indicates the site (e.g., <site-name>_annotations.json). 

Finally, replace your first name initial in the `annotations` column of `geojson_check.csv` with a 1.
